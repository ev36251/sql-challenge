# sql-challenge
Module 9 HW

The biggest challenge for me was the creating and importing of the tables. 

I had to stay after class with a guest TA Sean, and he helped me add the correct keys to my tables and then import the .sql code correctly.
He also gave me some code to help import the tables for the dept_emp and dept_manager tables. 
He also told me that the tables and column names should all be lowercase and to import the csv files from the tables that do not rely on other tables.

Once I got all the tables and information in, the SQL commands are not all that difficult to understand.
